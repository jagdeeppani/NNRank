Please run the file "minibench.m" to compare the different near-separable NMF algorithms, as done in our preprint "N. Gillis and R. Luce, Robust Near-Separable Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Using Linear Optimization, arXiv, February 2013". 

You can also run "Swimmer_test.m" to reproduce the comparison of the different near-separable NMF algorithms on the swimmer data set. 

CPLEX needs to be installed, see http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/ 
(see also http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419058 for info on the free licence for academia). 

You also need the Statistics Toolbox to generate the Dirichlet-type separable matrices. 

Please report any bug to nicolas.gillis@umons.ac.be.
